# Project Summary
This project is a text-based job database management system using Python, designed without external libraries.

It features:
* A custom CSV dataset with 11 attributes and 50+ records.
* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations implemented with file handling.
* Menu-driven user interface for navigating operations.
* Basic data analysis methods (e.g., null search, category checking, frequency counting, currency conversion, sorting).
* Mathematical, statistical, and business analysis methods (e.g., average, max, min salary calculations, job analysis by salary, experience-level salary averages).
* Use of multiple data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets.
* Application of core Python features such as OOP, file handling, loops, conditionals, and custom algorithms (linear search, selection, sorting).
A main program is included to test and demonstrate each function.
The project focuses on fundamental programming skills, algorithmic thinking, and file-based data management.

# Requirements
1. Create (or download and customize) one or more datasets (text files), related to one
of the following topics (can be selected by the students): Products, Invoices, Cars,
Books, Movies, Jobs. Dataset(s) must contain at least 6 attributes in minimum 25 lines.
2. Create methods to implement CRUD operations.
3. Create methods to handle the text file(s).
4. Create minimum 4 useful methods to implement the basic algorithms learned in the
lectures/seminars.
5. Create minimum 4 useful methods to implement mathematical, statistical, or business
calculations. 
6. Use as many data structures as possible from what you have learned.
7. Use as many Python-features as possible from what you have learned.
8. Create a main program to test each method.
OOP approach is recommended, but not compulsory. Avoid using external modules
(numpy, pandas ...).
